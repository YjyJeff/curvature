/// All of the local states must bounded by the `'static` lifetime, because the
/// [`std::any::Any`] trait requires it and the reason can be found [here]. However,
/// in the execution model, the [`PhysicalOperator`]s will always out-live its local
/// states, see [`PipelineExecutor`] for details. So when the local states need some
/// fields in the [`PhysicalOperator`] to make it self-contained, a simple solution
/// would be wrapping them into [`Arc`]. Pretty annoying ðŸ˜‚... Instead of using [`Arc`],
/// I would recommend to use `*const T`. The consequence is that we may run into the
/// undefined behavior if we use it incorrectly ðŸ™ƒ. Anyway, I know what I am doing now
/// and I will take responsibility for this hack!
