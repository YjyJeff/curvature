//! You may think we can use `get_mut_unchecked` to accelerate the PingPongPtr.
//! However, compared to computation we can see that the `get_mut` is cold.
//!
//! TODO:
//!
//! - Can PingPongPtr reduces the number of times inner data is cloned? We need
//!   at least one clone to send the data between threads
//!
//! - Should we allocate the memory in memory pool, and give the burden to

/// PingPong Pointer designed for query execution. It provides three methods:

/// - reference: mutate self, let self reference to other ping pong pointer
/// - exactly_once_mut: get the mutable reference to the data
///
///
/// # Why
///
/// Executing/Interpreting the expression is heavily used in the database. Each
/// expression's output should be written to the result. The result could be created
/// every time the expression is executed or a pre-allocated memory region that reused
/// across different DataBlocks.
///
/// In the first case, memory allocator has heavy pressure, lots of dynamic allocation
/// and de-allocation happens in the execution. The official implementation of the
/// `Arrow` use this method. Therefore, the second case is better. In the real word,
/// outputs may need to refer to the input, for example `ColumnExpr` read the input and
/// copy the input to the output. If we do not use `RefCountPtr`, we still need to copy lots
/// of memory between pre-allocated memory. To avoid this case, traditional
/// implementation use `Copy-On-Write(COW)` to avoid this problem. However, `COW` will
/// cause dynamic memory allocation. If we write different results, produced by
/// different DataBlock, to `COW` memory region and the region is always referred by
/// other memory region, we need to create a new memory region and copy the old memory
/// region every time. Which means that it fallbacks to the first case.
///
/// Could we use two memory region to solve the above problem? In expression execution,
/// we only want to write to a memory location and does not care about the old value
/// in the memory location. Therefore, we may call it `Create-On-Write`.
/// Instead of creating a new memory, we write the result to another memory region that
/// do not referred by others. Then the subsequent expression will release the reference
/// to the old one and refer to the new one. After the end of the expression, the old
/// one will not be referred by anyone else. Which means that, we can write the result
/// to the old one now! Let's call it [`PingPongPtr`] ðŸ˜Š
///
/// # Proof: Correctness of the [`PingPongPtr`] in the expression execution
///
/// Proposition: After the expression execution, one of the ping and pong is the unique
/// owner of the data
///
/// As we all know, an expression is represented as a **Tree** in the memory. Each node in
/// the tree is a concrete atomic expression, the expression can not be splitted into
/// smaller expression anymore. To execute the expression, DFS algorithm is used. Start
/// from the leaf node, each node takes inputs and produce outputs. Its outputs will be
/// the inputs of its parent. Therefore, we can view the edge in the expression tree as
/// data. Let's draw the [`line graph`] of the expression tree! We get a new tree, node
/// of the tree is the data produced by the expression and edge is the expression. Let's
/// execute this tree with DFS now. We can see that each node(data) will be written once
/// and then may read multiple times.
///
/// In the beginning state, each node(data) does not reference to other node(data). All
/// of the node(data)'s ping and pong are unique owner of the data
///
/// Assume after the k-th execution, the above proposition still holds. Let's proof after
/// the (k+1)th execution, the above proposition still holds.
///
/// For any node(`N``) in the tree, it will be write first via either `reference` or
/// `exactly_once_mut` methods.
///
/// - If the node is write via `reference`, then all of the subsequent node can not
/// create a reference to this node's ping and pong anymore. Then all of the subsequent
/// node will be visited and write once, which means that any node(`V`) that reference
/// to `N`, the reference will be dropped. Therefore, `N` is the unique
/// owner of both ping and pong
///
/// - If the node is write via `exactly_once_mut` methods, assume ping is being written
/// and can be read in the subsequent execution. It implies that pong may be referenced by
/// other nodes. Then all of the subsequent nodes will be visited and wite once,
/// which means that any node(`V`) reference to `N`, the reference will be dropped.
/// Therefore, `N` is the unique owner of the pong. Next execution can write to pong
